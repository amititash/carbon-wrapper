Stealth Startup

I’m seeking a head of product for a new venture I’m launching to enable 50MM+ expert-knowledge workers to more easily engage in fractional work. I’m a serial founder and part of a small team that is incubating new ventures. Prior to our current work, we have built two companies from PPT to acquisition. Prior companies were backed by top venture funds and we have commitments from former investors to back this new business.

The startup I’m launching supports expert-level knowledge workers who want to do some form of fractional work – either on-the-side or full-time. There are 20M expert-level knowledge workers already engaged in this type of work, but a much bigger market of them who want in but struggle to get started. Existing gig economy infrastructure and SaaS products don’t address the unique needs of this market. My prior startups include freelance marketplaces and SaaS for freelancers, and I see an opportunity to build a very different company in this huge market. We’ve built an early product with strong user feedback, and we have a clear point of view on the product we need to build for scale. I’m now building a team to bring this to market.

I’m looking for a world-class product leader to join the founding team who fits this description:


8+ years professional experience; 4+ in product design or product strategy
Experience building SaaS products with product-led growth, ideally having owned design from zero to one
Strong User Experience background with the ability to build end-to-end user experienced with for complex systems
Strong User Interface design background; ability to own full UI design of a responsive web app in Figma
Demonstrated evidence of being able to excel as a product leader; capable of working directly with engineering
Lots of startup experience - you’ve been a part of early stage startups – perhaps on the founding team before – and you love the zero to one startup culture and ambiguity.
Deep focus on the customer - Plenty of evidence of working backwards from customer needs, diving deep into market and customer research to understand what to build and what to adjust.
World-class communicator - You communicate incredibly well both verbally and in writing. You take pride in how you communicate and this is one of your superpowers.


If this sounds like you, please get in touch with me! Share your background and I'll reach out. Thank you for reading!

Important Notice:

At Integra Connect, we are committed to providing a safe and secure environment for our job applicants. Unfortunately, scammers may attempt to impersonate our company to deceive individuals seeking employment. We take this matter seriously and want to ensure your job search with us is free from any fraudulent activity.

Integra Connect has become aware of recent, fraudulent recruitment activity being conducted by individuals or groups who claim to be third party recruiters and/or points of contact for our Company. Examples include sending candidates a request for personal information, conducting online interviews or meetings, making offers of employment, demanding money for employment related services and activities, or asking the applicant to purchase a laptop or other work-related equipment for the job. The aim of the fraud is to obtain personally identifying information (e.g., identity theft) and/or money. The Company’s name, as well as the names of employees, are used to try to convey authenticity.

Here are some tips to help you identify and avoid job scams:

1. Always Check the Source:

Ensure that the job listing is on our official website or a reputable job board. Our official domain is https://www.integraconnect.com/resources/careers/. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or social media messages offering job opportunities.

2. Be Wary of Requests for Personal Information:

We will never request sensitive personal information like your Social Security number, bank details, or payment for onboarding/equipment. If you encounter such requests, it's likely a scam.

3. Verify Contact Information:

Check that the contact information provided in the job posting, including email addresses and phone numbers, aligns with our official contact information. Scammers often use generic or non-company email addresses.

What is the sender’s email address? Is it consistent with other job postings from this company? Email addresses that are slightly different from any business’s primary contact information (Jane.Doe@IntegraConnect.org vs John.Doe@Integra Connect.com) are a common warning sign.
If you are contacted through LinkedIn, be sure to review the entire profile to verify their credentials.

If you suspect that a job offer is fraudulent, we recommend that you do not respond to it.

If you believe you are the victim of any fraudulent activity, you can report it to the appropriate authorities at https://www.myfloridalegal.com/consumer-protection/how-to-protect-yourself-job-listing-and-job-search-firms (Florida Department of State) and/or https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/job-scams#report (U.S. Federal Trade Commission).

Integra Connect is not responsible for any fraudulent offers and advises prospective candidates to follow the guidance provided above.

Thank you for your interest in a career with Integra Connect. We look forward to connecting with genuine, talented individuals like you.
